POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week, President Obama met with VA Secretary Eric Shinseki over reports of treatment delays. "If these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful and I will not tolerate it," said Obama after the meeting. We should absolutely hold accountable those responsible for the recent suffering and deaths of America's veterans. But let's not stop with the VA. One reason the system is so overwhelmed is because of the tens of thousands injured in Iraq, an unnecessary war, which also claimed over 4,400 soldiers' lives. In 2003, Shinseki, then serving as Army chief of staff, testified it would take "several hundred thousand soldiers" to occupy Iraq. For speaking the truth about the recklessness and hubris behind the invasion, he was pushed aside by Bush, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz. So yes, there should be a price to pay for the unnecessary deaths of U.S. veterans -- but when will there be a price to pay for all those who were killed or are still suffering because of an unnecessary and immoral war?

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week, Americans fulfilled part of our responsibility to our government by filing taxes. But the government isn't doing its part in return. First, as a new report by the National Taxpayer Advocate showed, the IRS has been crippled by years of budget cuts, resulting in a "devastating erosion of taxpayer service" and filing misery for millions.

In more news from dysfunctional D.C., Attorney General-Designate Loretta Lynch remains in limbo, her nomination held hostage by Senate Republicans for over five months. On Friday, a clearly frustrated President Obama demanded, "Call Loretta Lynch for a vote...This is embarrassing." Meanwhile, the bigger "news" was the breathless scoop of Hillary Clinton eating at Chipotle. She had, we were told, a chicken burrito bowl (with guacamole).

Many Sanders supporters are far more militant than Sanders himself, and some are openly expressing the hope that Clinton will be indicted for some aspect of the email dust up. That seems highly improbable. However, Clinton has been unable to catch a break. The theme of her campaign has been experience and competence, but her improper use of a private email server suggested neither. It gives Trump a huge opening to challenge her honesty and probably signals a further decline in voter trust in Clinton.

In Arizona, the execution of murderer Joseph Wood went seriously awry, leaving him gasping for air for close to two hours before dying. Despite this grotesque death, Gov. Jan Brewer declared that Wood "did not suffer," but didn't explain how she could possibly know this.

If nothing else, Bush's extended run-up to actually running demonstrates how pointless and fake so much of campaign coverage is. And the "process journalism" doesn't stop after Election Day. On Friday, President Obama suffered a defeat on fast-track authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

Of course, Holder has agreed to remain in his post until his successor is confirmed by the Senate -- so, given the current state of D.C. dysfunction, he may be AG for some time to come. Finally, after a series of violent nightmares, the sports world delivered a fairy-tale ending as Derek Jeter capped his legendary career with a storybook walk-off hit in his last game at Yankee Stadium.

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week Donald Trump crossed the delegate threshold he needs to secure the Republican nomination. And the nation crossed the danger threshold of electing the most unstable, unready and extreme president in U.S. history. But not to worry, says Paul Manafort. In an interview with HuffPost's Howard Fineman, the Trump campaign manager assures us Trump will show America he can "fill the chair." And that ban on Muslims? "He's already started moderating on that," Manafort said. "He operates by starting the conversation at the outer edges and then brings it back towards the middle. Within his comfort zone, he'll soften it some more." The problem is that softened racism, xenophobia and misogyny are no less dangerous. Though the media, which has already retreated to horserace coverage, won't call Trump out, others will. Sheila Foster Anthony, sister of the late Vince Foster, spoke up about Trump's airing of conspiracy theories about her brother's death. "It is beyond contempt," she wrote, "that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy." But that's where Trump lives. And it should never be a part of America's comfort zone.

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week the nation had to clean up the collateral-mud-damage from watching Thursday's Republican debate. To call it a circus would be to insult the dignity, decorum and poise of the circus. "This guy's a choke artist, and this guy is a liar," said Trump of Rubio and Cruz, who finally took on The Donald. Meanwhile -- irony alert! -- Trump said former Mexican President Vincente Fox "used a filthy, disgusting word" and "should be ashamed." Even worse, the substance matched the atmosphere. After an extended debate on poll numbers, it was hard not to wonder how much better it would be if the candidates cared about meaningful data as much as poll data: like the new report that the seas are rising at their fastest rate in 28 centuries. Or that 22 million people would lose healthcare with Obamacare's repeal. Or that deporting 11 million people would cost an estimated $400 - $600 billion, take 20 years and lower real GDP by $1.6 trillion. But, of course, facts are for losers.

He never sugar-coated his insights, especially about recovery and redemption. "We all walk this earth feeling we are frauds," he wrote. "The trick is to be grateful and hope the caper doesn't end any time soon." Sadly, with David and Bob Simon, it ended much too soon.

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week brought two very different goodbyes. First, we said adios to 54 years of Cuban isolation policy, with President Obama lifting bans on travel and trade and resuming diplomatic relations. The other goodbye was to The Colbert Report. After nine years and 1,447 episodes, Stephen Colbert signed off in appropriate fashion, with Santa, a unicorn, Abe Lincoln, and a chess match with Death. Then, he was joined by dozens of former guests -- including Big Bird, Henry Kissinger, George Lucas, Katie Couric, James Franco, Cory Booker, Willie Nelson, and myself -- for a bittersweet version of "We'll Meet Again." After nearly a decade of Colbert, it's clear that what's truly special about him isn't his amazing wit, incredible timing, or even how staggeringly funny he is; it's his heart. Underneath his blowhard character, his humor consistently came from a place of compassion and truth (in the guise of truthiness) -- exactly what we need in these polarized times. Thankfully, we'll all be resuming ties with Colbert again soon.

I refer to the preventable catastrophe of the wipe-out of black home equity. Beginning in the 1970s, when the Federal government finally stopped colluding in racial redlining, black families at last got a reasonable shot at accumulating wealth via the dream of homeownership -- assets for one's old age and something to pass along to one's children. One of the most disgusting slanders by the right against low-income people and especially African Americans is the claim that the subprime collapse resulted from the government pressuring lenders to loan to unqualified borrowers. The vast majority of subprime loans were written by mortgage companies not even covered by federal law. Subprime was a scheme originated on Wall Street to profit from deceiving borrowers.

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week, the Senate released its report on America's use of torture after 9/11. The revelations were appalling: a detainee being chained naked to the floor and dying of exposure, another forced to stand on broken legs, more widespread use of waterboarding than previously known, and forced "rectal hydration" (in other contexts, known as rape). And not only did the CIA mislead Congress, but its claims -- repeated this week -- about the program's effectiveness were also unsupported by the evidence. It was a small step in accounting for one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history. But it's not enough to, as the president did, simply say we won't do it again. The larger question is: Why aren't the program's architects being prosecuted? The methods used, the president said, are "inconsistent with our values as a nation." And so is placing some people above the law for political expediency. Thankfully, there is no statute of limitations on torture.

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week, the nation watched as the Republican Party continued its awkward attempt to pretend Donald Trump is something other than a dangerous buffoon. On Thursday, Trump met with Paul Ryan, with the two calling the talk a "positive step toward unification," and Ryan adding that Trump is a "very warm and genuine person." If Ryan ends up endorsing Trump, he must be held accountable for what he's endorsing. As Senator Harry Reid said of his GOP counterpart, "Since Sen. McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, you can only assume he agrees with Trump's view that women are dogs and pigs." Rough stuff but he has a point: You either believe we should deport 12 million people or you don't. You either believe there should be a religious test to enter the U.S. or you don't. But the GOP isn't alone in its attempts to white-wash Trump. The New York Times referred to Trump's racism as "a reductive approach to ethnicity." This is how someone like Trump can actually get to the White House in 2016: because of the reluctance -- by political leaders and the media -- to call out racism when they see it.

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week, the House voted along party lines to open yet another Benghazi investigation -- adding to the 13 hearings and 50 briefings already completed. Democrats, who are considering boycotting the hearings, should instead hold alternate hearings on all the real and ongoing problems being ignored, like income inequality, gun deaths (approximately more than 40,000 since Benghazi), and climate change.

"The question," said one lead scientist, "is are we able to meet the challenges, given the growing understanding of how much the climate could change this century?"

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week the GOP debate circus pulled into Miami, ahead of Tuesday's Florida primary. It might have been more civil in tone, but it was actually much more frightening than the brawls of previous debates. Gone was the extreme rudeness, but as a result the extreme policies were harder to miss. Asked about torture and targeting civilians, Trump said that while we "have to obey the laws," we should simply "expand those laws," presumably to legalize what's currently illegal. When asked if all 1.6 billion Muslims hate us, he calmly replied, "a lot of them" do. Meanwhile, Rubio's answer to climate change was that we can't "change a law in Washington to change the weather!" And all suggested that we need to once again send ground troops to the Mideast (what could possibly go wrong?). Finally, when asked about increasing violence at his rallies, Trump blamed it on his supporters' anger about trade deals. And just days later, his canceled rally in Chicago nearly turned into a full-scale riot. Making America great again, indeed. Some have compared this to a reality show. If only that were true. This is reality, and we're all losing.

"We can't accept events like this as routine," said President Obama. Actually, that was what he said after Newtown, several mass shootings ago. This time the president was, rightfully, angrier and wearier. "I've had to make statements like this too many times," he said, noting that "at some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries." That reckoning should happen now -- right now -- even as the Confederate flag continues to shamefully fly at full mast above the South Carolina state house.

Ted Cruz kicked off his presidential campaign and wasted no time showing what kind of candidate he'll be by claiming that, in the wake of 9/11, he stopped listening to rock and switched to country music. Finding a way, 14 years later, to use 9/11 to pander and divide is as impressive as it is cynical. Next, Indiana Governor Mike Pence found an even older way to divide, signing into law a bill that would, essentially, legalize anti-gay discrimination. On the other side of the progress/regression ledger, the five-year anniversary of Obamacare saw the percentage of uninsured adults fall to 12.9 percent. And, in case you missed it (though your daughter might not have), One Direction member Zayn Malik announced his retirement from the mega-group, citing his desire to relax. When even a One Direction member can choose to go in another direction, it's a reminder that we can all break with the past for a happier, healthier future.

WELLNESS	Destressing the Holidays: Making a List, Checking It Twice Why does a season that's supposed to be about happiness and joy so often result in just the opposite? A survey by Consumer Reports found that 90 percent of Americans find at least one thing stressful about the holiday season (who are these 10 percent who feel no holiday stress?). Of course, it's possible that just having such expectations of the season to begin with, and then feeling the guilt at not meeting them, might be part of the problem. But whatever the reason, stress is what a lot of people will be unwrapping this year. Fortunately, much of it is returnable. So what follows are tips not only for holiday stress, but for the rest of the year as well. If you're in that 90 percent who's stressed out this week and next, this might be the list you should be checking twice. Your mind and body -- as well as your family -- will thank you.

WELLNESS	Millennials Come of Age as America's Most Stressed Generation First came the "Baby Boomers," then came "Generation X." The branding of the subsequent generation was less definitive, ping-ponging between "Generation Y" and "The Millennials." I'd like to add a third name: "Generation Stress." According to Stress in America, a study commissioned by the American Psychological Association, Millennials are the most stressed demographic. And it's reasonable to assume that higher levels of stress put the Millennials at higher risk for all sorts of destructive downstream consequences, from diabetes and obesity to anxiety and depression. Not surprisingly, work is one of the biggest causes of stress. The job numbers are grim, and even those lucky Millennials that land a decent job often face a workplace rife with destructive definitions of success. So here's hoping that as they advance through the ranks of the workplace, Millennials will do themselves -- and the generation after them (Generation Z?) -- a favor by redefining success.

This phrase refers to the 4th century Greek philosopher Diogenes's response to the question of whether motion is real -- he got up and walked. "It is solved by walking." As it turns out, there are many other problems to which walking is the solution. For instance: In our culture of overwork, burnout, and exhaustion, how do we tap into our creativity, our wisdom, our capacity for wonder, our well-being and our ability to connect with what we really value? Solvitur ambulando. By walking we move through the world not just physically, but also spiritually. Often by "taking a walk" we mean that we're not walking to get anywhere in particular. But even when we are walking toward a destination, when we're walking to connect two places, the in-between -- the space, the interval -- can be more important.

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week, America went to the polls. Despite much breathless post-election chatter about "mandates" and "midterm waves," the really big story was not who people voted for but how many people sat this one out. With only 37 percent of eligible voters heading to the polls, turnout was the lowest it's been since 1942 -- when voters were understandably distracted. The disconnect between the governed and the government has grown to historic proportions. Why? Perhaps because of the disconnect between a "recovering" economy and people's daily lives. This might explain why initiatives increasing the minimum wage were passed by huge margins in all four states where they appeared on the ballot, even as candidates opposing a long-delayed increase at the federal level won. People want change, but they've lost hope in the ability of national leaders to bring it. Those celebrating having their ticket to Washington paid for by lost faith and disillusionment should not miss this actual mandate.

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week, Ebola arrived in New York City -- America's most crowded and most media-saturated metropolis. So, as word spread on Thursday, so did the hysteria. But thankfully, Ebola (or "Ebowla," as some christened it in honor of the infected doctor's sporting foray the night before his symptoms appeared) remains much harder to spread than rumor and misinformation. As threats go, Americans have a greater chance of dying from a bee sting than catching Ebola. Meanwhile, Canadians are dealing with this week's deadly shooting in Ottawa. The media response there stood in stark contrast to ours. Any changes, The Globe and Mail wrote, should not be "as a panicky reaction to a very small number of men" who "are not an existential threat." We could learn much from our northern neighbors. As we heed NY Mayor de Blasio's warning to stay calm, we should also remember Montaigne, who said, "There were many terrible things in my life, but most of them never happened."

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week, Karl Rove suggested that Hillary Clinton might have suffered brain damage in 2012 when she was hospitalized after a fall that left her with a concussion. "Please assure Dr. Rove she's 100 percent," said a Clinton spokesman. Though Rove was obviously warming up his throat for the aria of sleaze that is sure to be sung in 2016, his talk of a candidate's health will hopefully open a wider debate -- though not the one Rove wants. Washington is a town fueled by burnout and overwork, and we now know from science the negative impact that approach to life has on decision-making -- which is clearly the main skill a president needs. No one seriously doubts Clinton's brilliance, but the kind of lives we lead govern whether we have access to our wisdom and best judgment. Rove's provocation aside, the public would be well-served if questions about how candidates plan to avoid burnout become a legitimate part of our political conversation.
