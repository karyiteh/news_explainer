POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week, the nation was once again shocked by the everyday, as a gunman killed nine at a community college in Oregon. It's the uniquely American gun paradox: how something so horrifying can be so routine. As a somber -- bordering on disgusted -- President Obama noted: "we've become numb to this." In truth, this actually isn't everyday violence -- it's more than everyday. In the 274 days of 2015, we've had 294 mass shootings. And 986 since Sandy Hook in 2012. The question is, when will our level of disgust be high enough that we do what's needed to lower the body count? "If you think this is a problem," said the president, "then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views." Until that happens, he said, we all bear a share of the blame: "We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction." Will we rise to the challenge?

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week we saw a demonstration of the deep connection between imagery and outrage. On Tuesday, the hunter that killed the beloved and often photographed lion, Cecil, in Zimbabwe was identified as Minnesota dentist Dr. Walter Palmer. As the outrage went viral, the hunter became the hunted. His clinic's website was shut down, and a White House petition demanding extradition got 190,000 signatures. But the level of viral indignation also prompted some to question why the outpouring of outrage for Cecil surpassed that prompted by the killing of Sandra Bland. At the same time, we watched as Ohio prosecutor Joe Deters -- fueled by very disturbing bodycam footage of the police shooting of Samuel DuBose -- announced murder charges in the case, calling the incident "outrageous," "horrendous" and an "absolute tragedy." It was further proof of the power of images -- and that outrage doesn't have to be an either/or proposition.

POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This was a week of goodbyes. On Tuesday, with big wins in the New York primary by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the chances for Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to win the nominations before the conventions didn't exactly leave the building, but they're headed for the exits. Later that night, Elizabeth Warren, in an epic Twitter rant, said goodbye to Ted Cruz's whining. In response to an email Cruz sent out about the "significant sacrifice" he was making by running, including that his "health and sleep are limited," Warren tweeted: "Know whose sleep is limited? Working parents who stay up worrying about getting kids thru college w/o big debt. @TedCruz blocked #refi." At least both agree on the importance of sleep. But the saddest goodbye came on Thursday with the news of Prince's death. He was an incredibly talented, versatile, gender-bending, glow-in-the-dark genius whose music was so undeniably human and irresistible - a force of harmony in a time of division.

"A girl, you're 30-years-old, you're not married -- you're an old maid," she said, satirizing the prevalent culture. "A man, he's 90-years-old, he's not married -- he's a catch!" That was 1967 on the Ed Sullivan Show. "My act spoke to women who weren't able to talk about things," she said. "I was talking about things that were really true." And she never stopped. Through all her iterations, struggles, ups and downs, there was never anything fake about her -- except for her plastic-surgery-altered face, which, of course, she gleefully lampooned. Asked what she wanted on her tombstone, she replied: "She had a great time." As did we.

POLITICS	Hillary Clinton Decides The World Is Wide Enough For Both 'Hamilton' And The Rest Of Her Speech Work!
POLITICS	Sunday Roundup This week the nation watched as the #NeverTrump movement folded faster than one of the presumptive nominee's beachfront developments. As many tried to explain away Trump's reckless, racist extremism, a few put principle over party. The wife of former Republican Senator Bob Bennett, who died on May 4, revealed that her husband spent his dying hours reaching out to Muslims. "He would go to people with the hijab [on] and tell them he was glad they were in America," she told the Daily Beast. "He wanted to apologize on behalf of the Republican Party." In the U.K., Prime Minister David Cameron called Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., "divisive, stupid and wrong." Trump's reply was that he didn't think he and Cameron would "have a very good relationship." The press is also doing its part to whitewash extremism. The New York Times called Trump's racism "a reductive approach to ethnicity," and said Trump's attitude toward women is "complex" and "defies simple categorization," as if sexism is suddenly as complicated as string theory. Not everybody's going along. Bob Garfield, co-host of "On the Media," warned the press of the danger of normalizing Trump. "Every interview with Donald Trump, every single one should hold him accountable for bigotry, incitement, juvenile conduct and blithe contempt for the Constitution," he said. "The voters will do what the voters will do, but it must not be, cannot be because the press did not do enough."
